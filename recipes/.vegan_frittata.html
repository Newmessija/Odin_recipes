    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and season the vegetables: on a pan add ½ cup of water, a finely sliced onion and sliced zucchini.
            Cook on medium heat until the zucchini is soft and the water is gone - it should take about 5 to 10
            minutes. Season well with a pinch of salt and pepper.
            <strong>TIP:</strong>You can use any vegetables of your choice. If you use broccoli, cauliflower, or sweet potatoes,
            steam them before, then season them with olive oil, salt and pepper before.</li>
        <li>While the vegetables cook, blend together water, chickpea flour, olive oil, salt and pepper for a couple of minutes till you have a very smooth batter. Set aside.
            <strong>TIP:</strong> you can use an immersion blender or a regular blender.</li>
        <li>Add the vegetables to the bowl with the chickpea batter and stir with a fork.</li>
        <li>On a different pan (should be non-stick and clean), add 1.5 tablespoon of olive oil, let it warm up for 30 seconds, then pour in the frittata batter and cook on low heat for about 4 to 5 minutes without touching it.</li>
        <li>After 5 minutes, make sure the frittata is not sticking to the pan anymore, then slide it on a plate, then turn it back into the pan and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes on low heat.</li>
        <li>Transfer onto a plate and enjoy as is, or sprinkled with some fresh herbs such as parsley, chives, or green onions.</li>   
    </ol>
